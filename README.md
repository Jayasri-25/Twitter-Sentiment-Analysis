# 🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Dashboard

---

## 📌 Abstract

Twitter generates massive real-time opinionated text, making it a valuable source for sentiment analysis. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning–based sentiment classification on a labeled Twitter dataset. The system analyzes tweets to understand sentiment polarity, linguistic patterns, and public emotions. The processed insights help in identifying trends, monitoring public mood, and supporting data-driven decision making.

## 📖 Introduction

Social media platforms like Twitter allow users to express opinions freely on various topics. Analyzing these opinions manually is difficult due to the large volume of data. Sentiment analysis helps automatically classify tweets into Positive, Negative, Neutral, or Irrelevant categories. This project focuses on understanding tweet data through EDA and predicting sentiment using machine learning models through an interactive web dashboard.

## ⚙️ Existing System

In the existing system, sentiment analysis is mainly performed using rule-based or keyword-matching techniques. These methods fail to handle slang, sarcasm, emojis, and noisy tweet structures, resulting in low accuracy and poor contextual understanding.

---

## 🚀 Proposed System

The proposed system uses machine learning techniques to analyze Twitter sentiment more effectively. It performs data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and sentiment prediction through a user-friendly web interface. The system improves accuracy and provides meaningful insights into public opinion.
